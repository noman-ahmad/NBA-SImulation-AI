NBA Artificial Intelligence Simulation

Description: the goal of this project is to accurately simulate a season of NBA Basketball
             using various artificial intelligence algorithms and implementations and using
             accurate current NBA data. 

Goals:
 - Implement a scheduling algorithm that appropriately generates a season's schedule for the 
   NBA including all 82 games for all 30 teams, using proper NBA scheduling rules such as 
   higher marketed teams getting christmas games, 41 home & away games for all teams, and 
   other important scheduling factors. 
 - Accurately simulate an NBA game, play by play using various decision making algorithms to
   properly represent player decision's and player tendencies. 
 - Use Accurate Player data to generate tendencies on how a player will play and have that 
   impact the play to play decision making. 
 - Use the game simulation to simulate an entire season of NBA basketball. 
 - Accurately display current player and team stats and incorportate a playoff tree.
